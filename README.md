# Controls of Ball on Beam

This implementation of the controls of a ball-on-beam system.

## Description

<p>A tiltable beam, controlled with a stepper motor was controlled using and Arduino Uno to stabilise the ball at any point specified on the beam. The position of ball was measured using an IR sensor and the distance was taken as a feedback to implement feedback linearised control on the beam. <p\>

<p>This is a platformio project used to upload the code on Arduino Uno. The problem is approached through OOP. There is a class to handle IR_sensor, Stepper Motor and even a class for the Controller itself. <p\>

<p>These classes provide standard templates that can be used in further projects too.<p\>
